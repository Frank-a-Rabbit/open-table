The purpose of this project is to create an OpenTable clone. App will allow for the following:

- As a user I can create an account via SSO
- As a user I can make reservations and member eateries
- As a user I can input receipt numbers into my account to earn rewards at member eateries
- As a user I can redeem rewards from member eateries to use on a future visit

- As a member admin I can create an account via SSO
- As a member I can create, update, and delete offers for end users
- As a member I can create criteria for users to redeem offers e.g. "For every $200+ spent in a month receive a free appetizer on next visit"
